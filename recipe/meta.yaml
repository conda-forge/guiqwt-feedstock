  summary: Automatic GUI generation for easy dataset editing and display with Python
  description: |
    Based on PythonQwt (a pure Python/PyQt reimplementation of the curve
    plotting Qwt C++ library, included in guiqwt base source code) and on the
    scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, guiqwt is a Python library providing
    efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image visualization and related
    tools) for interactive computing and signal/image processing application
    development. It is based on Qt graphical user interfaces library, and
    currently supports both PyQt4 and PyQt5.
